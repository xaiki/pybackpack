    How to install pybackpack
  -----------------------------

o Dependencies
  - python
  - pygtk
  - pyglade
  - rdiff-backup
  - genisoimage
  - nautilus-cd-burner (optional but currently needed for backup to CD/DVD)

o Intro
  Pybackpack uses distutils for its standard installation procedure so the
  setup.py script provides installation routines. Note that it doesn't provide
  uninstallation routines. If you require uninstallation and upgrade handling,
  that's what package managers are for. Consider using one.

o Installation
  To install pybackpack to the default place on your system, run as root:

     ./setup.py install

  If you wish to install it to a different root or prefix (e.g.
  --prefix=/usr/local) see ./setup.py install --help for options.
