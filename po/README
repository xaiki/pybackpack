For translators:

See this page for a more thorough guide:

 http://projects.sucs.org/projects/pybackpack/wiki/TranslationGuide

To translate Pybackpack into a different language:

1  If there is NOT already a .po file in your language (e.g. en_GB.po), copy
   pybackpack.pot to <LANG>.po
2. Edit <LANG>.po, inserting the translations of the msgid lines into the
   msgstr lines just below them. Ignore any lines which begin with #. For this
   step you might want to use a .po file editor such as poedit <http://www.poedit.net/>

To test your translations without installing Pybackpack you can use the
test-trans.sh script in the po/ directory like so:

   ./test-trans.sh <LANG>.po

Or, if the locale is different to your current locale:

   LC_ALL=<LOCALE> ./test-trans.sh <LANG>.po

For example:

   LC_ALL=it_IT.UTF-8 ./test-trans.sh it.po

To translate data/pybackpack.desktop, you can add Name[XX]= and Comment[XX]=
lines where XX is your language code.
  e.g. Name[en]=File backup manager

To submit your translation for inclusion in pybackpack, please email your
<LANG>.po file and your .desktop file changes to pybackpack@lists.sucs.org
stating clearly which version of Pybackpack the translation is for. (Hint:
Translations of the latest svn version are the most useful).


For developers:

Translation template pybackpack.pot generated using:

xgettext --copyright-holder='Andrew Price' --msgid-bugs-address=pybackpack@lists.sucs.org \
 -o pybackpack.pot ../pybackpack/*.py ../pybackpack/*.glade

Merge new strings into existing translations:

./merge-new.sh

Translators should not run the above two commands as they will generate a
different pybackpack.pot file and create inconsistencies.


Have a nice day.
